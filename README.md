Not a 'hello world' examples of using some interesting technologies

There is a problem with some modern technologies: a huge gap between a "hello world"-style examples and the real-life cases. Many potentially cool and useful libraries/frameworks/tools/etc lack the advanced examples. 

A well-known picture of "How to draw an owl" represents this problem well:

Here we try to gather some good nontrivial examples for different interesting technologies.
