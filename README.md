# Introduction

There is a problem with some modern technologies: a huge gap between a "hello world"-style examples and the real-life cases. Many potentially cool and useful libraries/frameworks/tools/etc lack advanced examples. 

A well-known picture of "How to draw an owl" represents this problem well:

# Nontrivial examples

Here we try to gather some good nontrivial examples for different interesting technologies.

## Python

* "[asyncio: We Did It Wrong](https://www.roguelynn.com/words/asyncio-we-did-it-wrong/)" A good example of how to use asyncio (async/await) in a non-toy case.
