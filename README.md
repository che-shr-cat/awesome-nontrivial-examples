# Introduction

There is a problem with some modern technologies: a huge gap between a "hello world"-style examples and the real-life cases. Many potentially cool and useful libraries/frameworks/tools/etc lack advanced examples. 

A well-known picture of "How to draw an owl" represents this problem well:

# Nontrivial examples

Here we try to gather some good nontrivial programming/architecture examples for different interesting technologies.

**Pull-requests are welcome!**

## Python

* "[asyncio: We Did It Wrong](https://www.roguelynn.com/words/asyncio-we-did-it-wrong/)" A good series of 8 posts on how to use asyncio (async/await) in a non-toy case.

## Event processing

* "[Why Kafka Streams didn't work for us?](https://aseigneurin.github.io/2017/08/04/why-kafka-streams-didnt-work-for-us-part-1.html)" A series of 3 posts on choosing between Kafka and Kafka Streams
* "[Centrifuge: a reliable system for delivering billions of events per day](https://segment.com/blog/introducing-centrifuge/)" A case from Segment on how they built a large event processing system

## Deep Learning

* "[Serving Google BERT in Production using Tensorflow and ZeroMQ
]"(https://hanxiao.github.io/2019/01/02/Serving-Google-BERT-in-Production-using-Tensorflow-and-ZeroMQ/) How to serve BERT with low latency and high scalability
